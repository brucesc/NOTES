SQL - Structured Query Language
Database (DB) - store and retrieve data
SSMS - SQL Server Managment Studio

SQL is a declarative language vs other languages we learn are procedural.
Procedural is very specific step by step
Declarative is broad, take the quiz is how you take the quiz.

SQL is not case sensitive
SQL use single quotes only ' not "

!= is not equal (! is not)

What is a database: a collection of tables
Table : a collection of rows and columns
Rows represent records - each person represented by a row
Columns represent fields - name, yrs experience, age, eye color, etc.. are represented by a column

SQL statement is called a Query
Table names are usually nouns

you can highlight something in SQLQuery to execute only that portion

***CREATE A REPOSITORY FOR SQL***

Ctrl + r hot key for SQL messages
Ctrl + n hot key for New Query

****Key word to remember while reading SQL tables: Select
1. Select (reading data)
2. could list all the columns out that you want to read or... for all the columns in the same order they are represented in the table use *(asterisk): field to view
3. From (prefaces the table name)
4. Table name (in our case is Customer)
		Select * From Customer

Order is a keyword in SSMS, so to tell SSMS that the table name order is not a keyword is [order]. turns order into an object not a keyword

Result Set: is the info spit out after Execute (F5)

**Join View (in SSMS/SQL): example 
	select Name, Date, Amount
	from [order]
	join customer
	on [order].customerid = customer.id

Alias for table name: example [order] o 
	o now represents [order]
Always follows from or join for table names
Alias for columns: as '---' example: Name as 'Customer Name'

**Inner Join: (type of Join View) two tables referenced with something in common

Manipulating the order of the output table (Result Set)
Order by Clause (almost aways will be the last thing in your Query)

Order by Clause: example
order by (column name), (column name) desc

**Outer Join (use left join) left means to produce in result set even if there isnt a value (NULL)

Null is null is null, has no value yes... it is its own thing. Does not have a value

Exercise: Do an inner join name date amount in desc

	select Name, Date, Amount
	from [order] o
	join customer c
	on c.id = o.customerid
	order by name, date, amount desc
